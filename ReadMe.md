## How to use our code
This application is a game where a user has to guess a five-letter word. They are given six chances
to enter a word. After every guess, the user is given information about whether each letter is 
in the word or in the right placement. To play, simply run the WordleApplication.java file and use
your keyboard to enter letters.
